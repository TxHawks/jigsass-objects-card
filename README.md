# JigSass Objects Card
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]  [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]   

 > An individual piece of distinguished UI

## Installation

Using npm:

```sh
npm i -S jigsass-objects-card
```

## Usage
First, you need to import JigSass Card:
```scss
@import 'path/to/jigsass-objects-card/scss/index';
```

And optionally [reconfigure](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-objects-card/#configuration) the defaults to your liking.

Like all other JigSass modules, JigSass Card does not automatically generate any CSS when imported.
In order to use its classes, you would have to first explicitly indicate your intention to use
them, using the [jigsass-card](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-objects-card/#card-mixin) mixin, 
Leaving us with small and maintainable css:

```scss
@include jigsass-card([$item, $modifier, $from-brekpoint, $until-breakpoint, $misc-breakpoint]);
```

All JigSass Card classes are responsive-enabled, using
[JigSass MQ](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-tools-mq/) and the breakpoints defined in the
[$jigsass-breakpoints](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-tools-mq/#variable-jigsass-breakpoints)
variable.

Based on the arguments passed to the jigsass-card mixin, responsive modifiers are
generated according to the following logic:

```scss
.o-card[--modifier|__item][-[-from-{breakpoint-name}][-until-{breakpoint-name}][-misc-{breakpoint-name}]]
```

So, assuming the `medium`, `large` and `landscape` breakpoints are defined in `$jigsass-breakpoints`
as `600px`, `1024px` and `(orientation: landscape)` respectively,

```scss
@include jigsass-card($modifier: raised);
```
will generate the `.o-card--raised` class, which is not limited to any media-query.

```scss
@include jigsass-card( $modifier: raised, $until: medium);
```

will generate the `.o-card--raised--until-medium` class, which will be in effect at
`(max-width: 37.49em)` and will override styles in the default class until that point.

```scss
@include jigsass-card($modifier: raised, $from: large, $misc: landscape);
```

will generate the `.o-card--raised--from-large-when-landscape` class, which will go into
effect at `(min-width: 64em) and (orientation: landscape)` and will override styles in the default
class under these  conditions.

Regardless of how many times a class is included, or where, it will only be generated once,
where the `jigsass-objects-card` partial was imported, leaving us with a css file as small
as possible, and a predictable cascade.

The `jigsass-card` mixin will also generate a `o-has-card` class the first time it is called, which
is used for setting the background color of elements containing cards.

## Contributing

It is a best practice for JigSass modules to *not* automatically generate css on `@import`, but 
rather have the user explicitly enable the generation of specific styles from the module.

Contributions in the form of pull-requests, issues, bug reports, etc. are welcome.
Please feel free to fork, hack or modify JigSass Card in any way you see fit.

#### Writing documentation

Good documentation is crucial for usability, scalability and maintainability. When 
contributing, please do make sure that both its Sass functionality (functions, mixins, 
variables and placeholder selectors), as well as the CSS it generates (selectors, 
concepts, usage exmples, etc.) are well documented.

Jigsass Card uses Jonathan Neal's [mdcss](//github.com/jonathantneal/mdcss).

When styles and documentation comments are not automatically generated by your module on `@import`,
please use the `sgSrc/sg.scss` file to enable their generation.

In addition, any file in `sgSrc/assets` will be available for use in the style guide.
